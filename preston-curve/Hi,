Hi,

Thanks again for running this progressive class which really embraces the possibilities of modern digital instruction.
I may have approached the assignment somewhat differently from you expectations, but I decided to take a liberal interpretation
of 'extending' the current analysis. Because reproducible computing is the core objective of this unit, there were
a couple of aspects of the project template which seemed like they could be moved forward in terms of reproducibility:

1. Adding Docker containers so that a versioned computational environment (as a source of truth) could be used to generate the paper.
1. Adding Github Actions CI/CD and using it to compile the paper automatically after every push, this way not only versioning,
but also a 'canonical' computational environment is defined.
1. Adding Github Superlinter and fixing linting errors in the template, so that collaboration is easier to align via automated 'guard rails'.

Note: In the interest of expediency, I deactivated the creation of the presentation.pdf file.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Cheers,
Jeremiah Lewis
